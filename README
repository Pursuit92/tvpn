Traverse Peer-to-Peer VPN System

Hamachi-like

Central Server for connection brokering

Clients get a peer browser to establish VPN links

OpenVPN for point-to-point vpn tunnels

	UDP transport for hole punching goodness

	Configures routes so that connections happen transparently

	TAP/TUN? Maybe provide both as options?

	TAP Pros:
		NETBIOS/Avahi functionality for name-based connections
			Con: May require the clients' internal IPs to be routed -
				 could cause conflicts with local subnets
		
		Broadcasts for zero-conf game connections
			Con: See Avahi con

		Generally anything requiring broadcasts will work
		Gives you a Layer 2 network

	TAP Cons:
		More overhead
		Uncertain scaling with lots of links running

	TUN Pros:
		Less overhead - only Layer 3

	TUN Cons:
		No broadcasts - less autoconfig

Connection steps:
	Still to be determined

Things to think about:
	Trust everyone on network? or individual keys?
